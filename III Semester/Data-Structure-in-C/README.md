# Data-Structure-in-C-Lab
This repository contains all the Data structure in C Lab's program in the Autonomous curriculum of Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering.

## Getting Started
Several options are available to get started:
* Clone the repo at `git clone https://github.com/rishabhlakhotia/CSE-Lab-Manual`
* Fork the repository if you think you can contribute back

## List of the programs
1. Write a C program to find best of two elements from an array using pointers.

2. Write an algorithm to create a student database using structure with following fields: USN, Name and Semester for 10 students and sort it according to USN using bubble sort.

3. Design, develop and execute a program in C to read a sparse matrix of integer values and to search the sparse matrix for an element specified by the user.

4. Design, develop and execute a program in C to convert a given parenthesized infix arithmetic expression to postfix expression and then print both the expressions. The expression consists of single character operands and the binary operators +, -, \*, /.

5. Design a C program to evaluate a valid postfix expression using stack.

6. Design a C program to simulate the working of a queue of integers using an array. Provide the following operations:
   * Insert
   * Delete
   * Display

7. Design a C program to perform following operations on Singly Linked List
   * Insert the node at the beginning
   * Insert the node at the end of the List
   * Display the List

8. Write a C Program to implement Singly Linked List using stack principles.

9. Design a C Program to implement a double linked list where each node consists of integers.

10. Design a C Program to create a max heap of integers by accepting one element at a time and by inserting it immediately in to the heap. Use the array representation for the heap. Finally display the heap.

11. Design a C program to create a Binary Search Tree and perform the following operations
    * In-Order Traversal
    * Pre-Order Traversal
    * Post-Order Traversal

12. Write a C program to construct a BST for the given array elements and display the elements using the array indexing.
